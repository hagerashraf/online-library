you can search for a book by its name or author's name when trying to borrow a book 
Description of the code:
starting from line 18 to line 115 this is the data base for the program.
starting from line 120 up to line 167 this is the choice 1's code which is to insert a book to the inventory for the library
starting from line 169 up to line 203 this is the 2nd choice's code which is for borrowing books 
starting from line 206 up to line 214 this is the 3rd choice's code which is for checking for a book in book returns
starting from line 216 up to line 226 this is the 4th choice's code which is for searching for a member and retreiving the book/s he borrowed
starting from line 227 up to line 247 this is the 5th choice's code which is for deleting a copy/book from the inventory 
starting from line 248 up to line 262 this is the 6th choice's code which is for deleting a user 


The program represents a library that holds on its data base eight users with their ID ranging from 0 to 7 with names respectively as follows (Ahmed,Omar,Taha,Marry,Rawda,Mohamed,Hager,Haidy)
and holds a list of 15 books on its shelves respectively named ( The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F , Talking to Strangers, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Big Magic, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone, What We Carry, Evonne Goolagong, Pirate Queen, Rebel Cinderella, Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood, Fundamenetals of electric circuits, Introduction to electric circuits, Electric Machinery Fundamenetals, Signals and systems, Linear algebra and its applications)
along with its coressponding data of publishing, authors' names and number of copies of each book .
the data also holds a list of the borrowed books and a list of the returned books.

Option 1 in the program allows the user to insert a book but first it asks about the book's name to search about it in the inventory so if the book was found it increases its number of copies 
if the book was not found it allows the user to insert the new book and asks about the book's name, date of publishing, author and how many copies the user wants to insert
- it asks many questions about the book along the way so follow and answer each question also please the book's name with each word having its initial capitalized
so as for the program to find the book in the inventory if it was there-

Option 2 in the program allows the user to borrow a book but first it asks about the user's name because the borrowing option is allowed only to users.
if it was a user it will ask about the duration he/she would borrow the book for, if it was more than 14 days it woudn't allow the borrowing, less than 14 days it will ask about the name of the book ,the number of books to be borrowed, and many others questions so answer them along the way
if it wasn't a user it wouldn't allow the borrowing 

Option 3 in the program allows the user to check for books in return it will ask about the name of the book so please insert the book's name with the initial of each word of the book's name capitalized 

Option 4 in the program allows the user to search for a member by his name and then it retrieves the name /s of the books he borrowed 

Option 5 in the program allows the user to delete a copy - it empties- its place on the shelf.

Option 6 in the program allows the user to delete a member -it empties- its place on the member list.
